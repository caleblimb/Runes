# Runes 

This is a 2D game engine. Rendering and other calculations are all CPU based. System compatibility should not be an issue as long as you can run java as all of the code is self contained and only uses built-in Java libraries.

Almost all of the code in this project was written from scratch. The rendering and some of the simple game mechanics are based on [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject)'s [Game Programming Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98c-CeNT-q_Z7ox3R_eIkF98).
